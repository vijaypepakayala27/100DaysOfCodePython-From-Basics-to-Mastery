#A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization. 
#In other words, a palindrome remains unchanged when its order of characters is reversed.

# Here is a Python code to check if a given word is Palindrome

user_input = input("Enter a word or phrase: ")
normalized_input = user_input.lower().replace(" ", "")  # Normalize input
reversed_input = normalized_input[::-1]  # Reverse the input

# Compare and print result
if normalized_input == reversed_input:
    print("It's a palindrome!")
else:
    print("It's not a palindrome.")
